knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Purpose
The purpose of this vignette is to check the Nyakatoke village data provided
in (source) and compare descriptive statistics with what is stated in published
works.

## Data loading/saving

This part of the code is simply loads the raw data in the extdata folder and
saves it as an R data set

```{r datamunging}
baseLoc <- system.file(package="riskSharing") 
extPath <- file.path(baseLoc, "extdata") 
```

```{r nyakatoke_data, eval=FALSE}
raw_data <- read.csv(file.path(extPath, file.path("tanzania_data.csv")))
save(raw_data, file = "data/nyakatoke.RData")
```
